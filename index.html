                Hi, everybody! Thanks for stopping by to learn a little bit more about me. Below you will find my work, as well as a way to get in contact with me. I am a coder based out of L.A., however, I grew up in a little town in the midwest called Fargo, North Dakota (also know as the frozen tundra). I enjoy playing strategy based games like chess and Team Fight Tactics with my friends, working out, and performing - whether it's singing and dancing in a musical or light designing for rock concerts. Thank you for stopping by to learn about me, againg you can check out my work below and contact me below as well.
